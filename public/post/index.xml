      <description>Welcome to my weekly election blog for the upcoming 2022 midterms in November. The goal of this blog is to create a prediction for both the seat share and the popular vote for each party within the House of Representatives. I will use this blog to explain changes and additions to my prediction model. I will also provide graphics that support my claims and data reasoning.
This first post serves as an introduction to this upcoming election by analyzing the outcomes of past recent midterms.</description>
